knitr::include_graphics('figures/data_transformation_pipeline.png')
```

## Step 1: Data Loading and Initial Structure

### Process Description
The analysis begins with loading miRNA count data from the Q33.txt file. This file contains miRNA expression data with mutation information for multiple samples.

### Key Operations:
- Load raw miRNA count data
- Examine initial data structure and dimensions
- Identify column types (miRNA identifiers, positions, mutation types, sample counts)
- Validate data integrity and completeness

```{r step1-data-loading, fig.cap='Step 1: Data loading and initial structure examination.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step1_data_loading.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 1:
- **Rows**: Individual miRNA entries
- **Columns**: miRNA identifiers, position information, mutation types, sample-specific counts
- **Format**: Wide format with samples as columns

## Step 2: Column Naming and Structure Standardization

### Process Description
Standardize column names and structure to ensure consistency across the analysis pipeline.

### Key Operations:
- Convert miRNA.name to miRNA_name
- Standardize position column (pos.mut → pos)
- Identify count columns (sample names)
- Identify total columns (sample names with ..PM.1MM.2MM. suffix)
- Create mapping between count and total columns

```{r step2-column-structure, fig.cap='Step 2: Column naming and structure standardization.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step2_column_structure.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 2:
- **Standardized column names** for consistency
- **Clear separation** between count and total columns
- **Validated column structure** for downstream processing

## Step 3: Split Function Application

### Process Description
Separate combined mutation data into individual rows for detailed analysis of each mutation type.

### Key Operations:
- Split combined mutations (e.g., 'G>T,A>C') into separate rows
- Preserve all sample count and total information
- Maintain data integrity during transformation
- Create one row per miRNA-mutation combination

```{r step3-split-function, fig.cap='Step 3: Split function application to separate combined mutations.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step3_split_function.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 3:
- **Increased number of rows** (one per mutation type)
- **Same column structure** maintained
- **Individual mutation analysis** enabled

## Step 4: Collapse Function Application

### Process Description
Aggregate duplicate miRNA-mutation combinations while preserving sample-specific information.

### Key Operations:
- Identify duplicate miRNA_name + pos + mutation_type combinations
- Sum counts across identical combinations
- Aggregate total columns accordingly
- Reduce data redundancy while preserving information

```{r step4-collapse-function, fig.cap='Step 4: Collapse function application to aggregate duplicate combinations.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step4_collapse_function.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 4:
- **Decreased number of rows** (duplicates removed)
- **Same column structure** maintained
- **Unique combinations** only

## Step 5: VAF Calculation Process

### Process Description
Calculate Variant Allele Frequencies (VAFs) for each sample and mutation combination.

### Key Operations:
- Calculate VAF = count / total for each sample
- Handle division by zero (VAF = 0 when total = 0)
- Handle missing totals (VAF = NaN when total is NA)
- Apply across all sample columns simultaneously

```{r step5-vaf-calculation, fig.cap='Step 5: VAF calculation process for all samples.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step5_vaf_calculation.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 5:
- **Added VAF columns** for each sample
- **Preserved original counts and totals**
- **Ready for frequency-based analysis**

## Step 6: G>T Mutation Filtering

### Process Description
Focus analysis on G>T mutations as markers of oxidative damage, which is particularly relevant for ALS research.

### Key Operations:
- Filter data to include only G>T mutation types
- Remove other mutation types (A>C, C>T, etc.)
- Maintain sample structure and VAF calculations
- Prepare for oxidative load analysis

```{r step6-gt-filtering, fig.cap='Step 6: G>T mutation filtering for oxidative damage analysis.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step6_gt_filtering.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 6:
- **Reduced number of rows** (G>T only)
- **Same column structure** maintained
- **Oxidative damage focus** established

## Step 7: RPM Normalization

### Process Description
Normalize data for sequencing depth differences and apply expression level filters.

### Key Operations:
- Calculate RPM = (count / total_reads) * 1,000,000
- Normalize for sequencing depth differences
- Apply RPM > 1 filter for meaningful expression
- Remove low-expression miRNAs

```{r step7-rpm-normalization, fig.cap='Step 7: RPM normalization and expression filtering.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step7_rpm_normalization.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 7:
- **Depth-normalized data**
- **Expression-filtered miRNAs**
- **Biologically relevant mutations** only

## Step 8: Group Assignment

### Process Description
Assign samples to ALS vs Control groups based on sample naming conventions and metadata.

### Key Operations:
- Assign samples to ALS vs Control groups
- Validate group assignments
- Ensure balanced group sizes where possible
- Create group metadata for statistical analysis

```{r step8-group-assignment, fig.cap='Step 8: Group assignment for comparative analysis.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/step8_group_assignment.png')
```

### Data Structure After Step 8:
- **Group assignments** added
- **Ready for comparative analysis**
