**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21

---

## Scientific Background

This pipeline analyzes **8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) damage** in microRNAs (miRNAs), which is a biomarker of oxidative stress. The primary signature of 8-oxoG damage is **G>T mutations**, which occur when guanine is oxidized and mispairs with adenine during reverse transcription.

### Key Scientific Concepts

- **8-oxoguanine**: Most common oxidative DNA/RNA lesion
- **G>T mutations**: Primary signature of 8-oxoG damage
- **Seed region**: Positions 2-8 in mature miRNAs, critical for target binding
- **VAF (Variant Allele Frequency)**: Proportion of reads containing the mutation
- **Oxidative stress**: Imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants

- Examines G-content distribution
- Compares seed vs non-seed regions
- Analyzes G>T specificity

**Outputs:**
- 6 figures: Dataset evolution, mutation spectra, positional patterns
- 6 tables: Summary statistics

**Key metrics:**
- Total G>T mutations
- G>T distribution across positions

---

### Step 1.5: VAF Quality Control

**Purpose:** Remove technical artifacts and ensure data quality.

**What it does:**
- Calculates VAF for all mutations
- Filters artifacts: VAF ≥ 0.5 (technical artifacts)
- Generates diagnostic visualizations
- Reports filter impact

**Critical filter:**
- **VAF ≥ 0.5 → Filtered** (artifacts)
- **VAF < 0.5 → Kept** (biological signal)

**Why important:**
- VAF = 0.5 often indicates sequencing errors or technical artifacts
- Removing these improves signal-to-noise ratio

**Outputs:**
- 11 diagnostic figures
- 7 tables (filtered data + reports)

---

### Step 2: Statistical Comparisons

**Purpose:** Compare groups statistically and identify significant differences.

**What it does:**

1. **Assumptions Validation:**
   - Normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
   - Variance homogeneity tests (Levene's, Bartlett's)
   - Automatic test selection (parametric vs non-parametric)

2. **Batch Effect Analysis:**
   - PCA visualization
   - Statistical testing for batch effects
   - Batch correction (if enabled)

3. **Confounder Analysis:**
   - Group balance assessment (age, sex)
   - Covariate analysis

4. **Group Comparisons:**
   - t-test (parametric)
   - Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-parametric)
   - FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
   - Effect size calculation (Cohen's d)

5. **Position-Specific Analysis (NEW):**
   - Analyzes each position individually (1-24)
   - Statistical testing per position
   - Generates position-specific bar chart

**Filters applied:**
- G>T mutations only
- Statistical significance: `FDR < alpha` (default: 0.05)

## Key Concepts

### VAF (Variant Allele Frequency)

```
VAF = (Count of mutated reads) / (Total reads)
```

- **VAF = 0.5**: Often technical artifact (filtered)
- **VAF < 0.5**: Biological signal (kept)
- **VAF = 0.01**: Low-level mutation (1% of reads)

### Seed Region

Positions **2-8** in mature miRNAs:
- Critical for target binding
- Mutations here have functional impact
- Higher G-content → more susceptible to oxidation

### Statistical Significance

- **p-value**: Raw statistical significance
- **FDR (False Discovery Rate)**: Multiple testing correction
- **Log2FC**: Fold change (log2 scale)
  - Log2FC > 0: Higher in group 1
  - Log2FC < 0: Higher in group 2
  - Log2FC > 0.58: ~1.5x fold change

---

## Adaptive Thresholds

The pipeline includes adaptive threshold detection:

- **<5 significant mutations** → Warning: "Low signal detected"
- **>90% data filtered** → Warning: "Excessive filtering"
- **Max AUC < 0.6** → Warning: "Poor biomarker performance"
- **|correlation| < 0.2** → Warning: "Weak correlation"

These warnings help identify when the dataset may not have sufficient signal.

---

## Output Interpretation

### Statistical Results

**S2_statistical_comparisons.csv:**
- `significant = TRUE`: Mutation is significantly different between groups
- `log2_fold_change > 0`: Higher in group 1 (e.g., Disease)
- `log2_fold_change < 0`: Higher in group 2 (e.g., Control)

### Position-Specific Results

**S2_position_specific_statistics.csv:**
- Shows which positions (1-24) have significant differences
- **Position 2-8**: Seed region (functionally important)
- **Position 21-22**: Often high mutation rates (less functional impact)

### Biomarker Results

**S4_roc_analysis.csv:**
- **AUC > 0.8**: Excellent biomarker
- **AUC 0.7-0.8**: Good biomarker
- **AUC < 0.6**: Poor biomarker (may not be useful)

## Best Practices

1. **Always check Step 1.5 outputs** to verify data quality
2. **Review Step 2 position-specific analysis** to identify key positions
3. **Use metadata file** for reliable group assignment
4. **Check adaptive threshold warnings** to assess data quality
5. **Review functional analysis** in context of disease biology
